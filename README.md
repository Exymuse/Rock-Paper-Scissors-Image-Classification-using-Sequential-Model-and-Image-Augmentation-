# Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classification using Sequential Model and Image Augmentation
Author: Cakra Satriyadana


This repository contains a Machine Learning classification project completed as part of the Dicoding Machine Learning course. The project utilizes a dataset of rock, paper, and scissors images and implements an Image Model Deployment for classification.

The main objective of this project is to train a model that can accurately classify images into â€˜rockâ€™, â€˜paperâ€™, or â€˜scissorsâ€™ categories. This is achieved through the use of image augmentation techniques and a sequential model.

The project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. The trained model achieved an accuracy of **0.9750**on the training set and a validation accuracy of **0.968**, indicating a high level of performance in image classification tasks.

Feel free to explore the repository for a deeper understanding of the project. Any feedback is appreciated!

Happy exploring! ðŸ˜Š
